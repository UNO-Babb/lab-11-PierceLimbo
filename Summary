Grocery Store Simulation Summary

In this lab, I learned how event based simulation works using the SimPy library. The simulation modeled a grocery store with shoppers arriving, shopping, and entering a checkout queue.
I made separate processes for shoppers, checkers, and customer arrival, which gave me a better understanding of how simulations work.

With only one or two checkers, the wait times grew quickly and the number of shoppers stuck in the queue increased.
Adding more checkers reduced wait time significantly, and idle time increased when capacity exceeded demand.
This demonstrated the balancing act between staffing levels and system load.

I also improved my ability to gather and analyze simulation metrics, like average wait time, average shopping time, average number of items purchased, and total checker idle time.
By adjusting variables such as arrival rate, number of items, and number of checkers, I could see how system behavior changed.
This helped me understand how simulations are used to optimize real-world processes without needing physical trial and error.

Overall, this lab taught me how event simulations work, how queues form and resolve, and how small operational changes can dramatically affect performance in a service environment.
