Grocery Store Simulation Summary

I always enjoy labs like this. I love playing the weird games where you can run a store or something like that and manage merchandise and checkout lanes.
It's oddly satisfying and it's fun to be able to collect the data.

Finding the balance with the checkers is truly an art and it's so interesting to me.
From my little time working in a grocery store, I'd always observe the balance and think about what I'd do.
So it was cool to check the different number of checkers and see how it affected the results. 

I do a lot of analysis and metric measuring for work, so it was nice to be able to improve my skills by finding averages like wait time. 
Being able to manipulate the variables was also very nice as I normally work with hard numbers.
This will most definitely help with understanding real world processes more.
